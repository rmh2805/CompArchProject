Addendum:

- In general, RTL files submitted previously have been updated in the course of 
debugging while translating into microcode. I also belive that the microcode 
execution RTL has been updated inside of `uCodeFmt.txt`

- The microcode format and hardware have been updated to include a few new 
systems registers, most notably a uRet2 and uTmp2 included to allow for certain 
unrealized complexities in microcode, 2 pair of new registers to track the 
overflow and carry flags of ALU 2 in order to allow for jumps on those flags, 
and another single register to act as a hypothetical buffer between users and 
an output port;

- The hardware has also been updated to include a connection between the uPC and
the A input of ALU 2 as well, to allow for otherwise unrealized parallelism.

- The microcode formate has been updated to include 3 new micro conditionals: 
    1. PC Max, which checks if the PC is prepared to overflow
    2. Overflow, which checks if the saved overflow bit is set
    3. Carry, which checks if the saved carry bit is set
